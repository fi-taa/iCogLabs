# Transfer learning

Transfer learning (TL) is **a machine learning (ML) technique where a model pre-trained on one task is fine-tuned for a new, related task**. Training a new ML model is a time-consuming and intensive process that requires a large amount of data, computing power, and several iterations before it is ready for production.$[1]$ 

Transfer learning summary $[2]$
	1. Download neural network parameters pretrained on a large dataset with same input type (e.g., images, audio, text) as your application (or train your own)
	2. Further train (fine tune) the network on your own data.
